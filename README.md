# Agile.Pixel Front-End Challenge

This project is a technical front-end challenge for Agile.Pixel. It demonstrates my skills and understanding of front-end development. For this simple project I decided to use[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) with pure CSS (why make your life easier with tailwind? :P)
